        <h2>Scientific Vision</h2>
        <p>I am dedicated to increasing our understanding of how human behaviour affects the immune system. This covers behaviours relating to diet, exercise, sleep, social interaction, and stress (among others). My current focus is on the interplay between circadian health and immunity, particularly with respect to timing of food intake and T cell immunity against cancers.</p>

        <h2>Research Experience</h2>
        <p><strong>A novel role for CDC42 in killer T cells</strong><br>Prof Gillian Griffiths | October 2020 – January 2025 | CIMR, Cambridge, UK<br>Discovered the expression of an unusual splice isoform of CDC42 in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Elucidated the role of this protein isoform in activating dynein-mediated transport of secretory lysosomes towards the immune synapse for CTL-mediated killing. Manuscript under review at Journal of Cell Biology and is available upon request.<br>Discovered potent transcriptional adaptation (TA) in CTLs in response to CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of Cdc42. Characterised the molecular pathways leading to enhanced CTL function after TA. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.263826">Publication</a>.<br>Collaborations: Carsten Speckmann (University of Freiburg, Germany), Doreen Cantrell (University of Dundee, Scotland)</p>
        <p><strong>Visualizing forces during T cell migration and killing</strong><br>Prof Gillian Griffiths | October 2020 – January 2025 | CIMR, Cambridge, UK<br>Optimised novel actin conformation probes for use in CTLs. Optimised traction force microscopy for CTLs. Discovered spatiotemporal correlation between distinct F-actin conformations and force production by CTLs. Manuscript submitted to Nature Communications. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.15.654337">Preprint</a>.<br>Collaborations: Dan Fletcher (UC Berkeley, USA), Anna Lippert (University of Würzburg, Germany), Alex Winkel (University of Cambridge, UK)</p>
        <p><strong>Characterisation of T cell dysfunction from PID patients</strong><br>Collaboration with Dr Alex Kreins | October 2023 – November 2024 | Great Ormond Street Hospital & UCL<br>Discovered a unique cellular phenotype in the CTLs from patients with a novel ∆RAB27A mutation, whereby CTL function is maintained despite loss of canonical granzyme/perforin-mediated killing pathway. These data formed the basis for grant applications for future work proposing cellular phenotyping of patients with inborn errors in immunity to predict future immunodeficiency.<br>Determined the impact of novel ITPR3 mutations on calcium homeostasis and nuclear translocation of transcription factors in patient CTLs. <a href="#">Publication</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Imaging the T-cell receptor: new approaches, new insights</strong><br>Prof Gillian Griffiths | April 2020 – August 2020 | COVID-19 lockdown<br>MRes Rotation III<br>Literature review discussing the potential for imaging modality to bias results regarding the localisation and dynamics of the T cell receptor, particularly in the resting T cell. <a href="#">Publication</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Engineering synthetic nucleic acids to cleave cancer-associated microRNAs</strong><br>Dr Alex Taylor | January 2020 – April 2020 | CITIID, Cambridge, UK<br>MRes Rotation II<br>Designed and tested xenonucleic acid enzymes based on FANA chemistry to cleave microRNAs implicated in cancer, achieving exceptionally specific activity amongst similar miRNA family members. <a href="#">Dissertation</a>, <a href="#">publication</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Screening for vaccine targets in blood-stage form Plasmodium vivax</strong><br>Prof Julian Rayner | October 2019 – December 2019 | Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK<br>MRes Rotation I<br>Expressed, purified, and tested the in vitro efficacy of surface proteins from P. vivax with immunogenic potential as vaccine targets. <a href="#">Dissertation</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Investigating the regulation of a novel anti-fungal compound in the bacterial plant pathogen Dickeya solani</strong><br>Prof George Salmond | October 2018 – April 2019 | Dept. of Biochemistry, Cambridge, UK<br>MSci Research Project<br>Screened an important potato pathogen for regulatory genetic elements and operon structure involved in secretion of a novel anti-fungal compound crucial to its virulence. Characterised implicated genes functionally. <a href="#">Dissertation</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Investigating the effect of ligand size on rate of endocytosis in the sleeping sickness-causing protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei</strong><br>Prof Mark Carrington | January 2018 – March 2018 | Dept. of Biochemistry, Cambridge, UK<br>BA (hons.) Research Project<br>Determined that hydrodynamic resistance, correlated with ligand size, is a crucial driver in rate of endocytosis at the flagellar pocket for the causative parasite of sleeping sickness. These data explain why antibody immunity is ineffective, whilst nanobody therapy has powerful anti-parasitic potential. <a href="#">Dissertation</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Investigating immune cell distribution in virally infected peripheral tissue</strong><br>Dr Brian Ferguson | July 2017 – August 2017 | Dept. of Pathology, Cambridge, UK<br>Undergraduate Summer Research Internship<br>Determined the spatiotemporal characteristics of the T cell response to murine viral infection in vivo. Work was presented orally to the Virology Division within the Department of Pathology.</p>
